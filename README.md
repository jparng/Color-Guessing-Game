# Color-Guessing-Game

A very simple game to guess the color that is stated in the heading. Incorrect clicks will cause the clicked square to disappear, but clicking the correct one will cause all the squares to change color to the correct color. Choosing easy mode will have the user guess up to three squares. This game helped me understand DOM manipulation more. Other experiences gained include more CSS styling, using hover and transitions to make the webpage feel more responsive.

You can see how the code works by checking it out in github-pages in the environment section.
